# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Market Analysis using Regression, Classification, and Fusion Techniques

This project explores **stock price prediction** using both numerical stock data and textual news headlines. We implemented a **multi-model pipeline** involving polynomial regression, custom random forest classification, and a fusion neural network that combines both data types for enhanced performance. The focus is on **Baidu stock prices** and their related news headlines.

## Project Overview

- **Regression Model:** Polynomial Regression (degree=10) for predicting stock prices using OHLC data.
- **Classification Model:** Random Forest Classifier using TF-IDF on news headlines to extract sentiment signals.
- **Fusion Model:** A neural architecture combining both numerical and textual features for superior stock price prediction.
